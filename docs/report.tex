Dynamic programming can be used to perform contour detection in a feasible
period of time. In this project, a dynamic programming algorithm was created for
exracting a tongue from an X-ray image. The algorithm was tested to see how it
scales with the number of divisions, how it performs with varying lambda and how
it performed of different images.

\section{Introduction}
Dynamic programming is a method of reducing a search space when finding an
optimum solution to a complex problem. It relies on the fact that the problem
can be broken up into smaller, simpler problems. Compared to the brute force
method of evaluating all possible contours, dynamic programming is very
efficient.

\section{Method}
For this project, I chose to use Matlab as it provides good matrix and vector
manipulation functionality. 

When approaching this task, I broke it up into several scripts and functions,
each with a single clearly defined purpose.  

\subsection{Search Space Extraction}
In my Matlab code, the function \em GenerateSearchSpace \em takes in a number of
divisions, an image and two contours. It returns a matrix of vertices and a
matrix of intensities. This differs slightly from the original specification,
but the matrix of vertices offers an easy way to convert back to image space
from search space. 

The function then loops over each point in the contours. For each point on
the first contour, the distance from the corresponding point on the second
contour is calculated. This distance is then used to interpolate the correct
number of points to sample between the two lines. 

For each of these interpolated points, a sample is taken. Initially I
implemented a function \em BasicSample \em which simply rounded the point to
the nearest integer an used the value of image at this pixel. I later extended
this by creating a function \em MultiSample \em which was loosely based on a
Gaussian sampling and sampled the pixels surrounding the rounded pixel with
weights proportional to the distance from the point.

I then inverted the matrix of intensities to enable the minimization algorithm
to detect the line. I also added a low-pass filter to see what difference it
would make.  

\subsection{Dynamic Programming Search}
I began by creating a simple dynamic programming algorithm based on the on in
the slides provided. \em reference? \em This algorithm attempted to minimise
intensity, to find the white pixels of the original image, and ensure
continuity, to ensure that the line was actually a line. 

The algorithm built up two dimensional energy and position matrices by finding
the minimum energy required to get to each point, based on the minimums to get
to the previous points. It then backtracked from the lowest intensity,
producing a contour. I designed my implementation to be as modular as possible
to enable easy debugging and extension.

Once I had a this solution working, I began extending it to implement the
algorithm defined in the specification. \em reference? \em This required the
energy and position matrices being expanded into the third dimension to
represent all of the possible points that could be the next point in the line.
